# LLM Knowledge Engineering Patterns

##  -- WORKING IN PROGRESS Repo-- 

**Design patterns and system architectures for LLM-powered knowledge accumulation and retrieval systems.**

This repository provides practical patterns and reference architectures for building systems that enable *continuous human knowledge accumulation* using modern LLMs (Large Language Models), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), Small Language Models (SLM), memory systems, agentic workflows, and self-improving pipelines.

## üåü Purpose

To document, experiment with, and share **actionable system designs** for:

- Capturing knowledge from unstructured sources
- Organizing and indexing knowledge for retrieval
- Enabling dynamic synthesis of knowledge through LLMs
- Building long-term, evolving knowledge systems
- Supporting collective and individual intelligence with AI
